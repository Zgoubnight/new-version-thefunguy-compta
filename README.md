## ÔøΩÔøΩ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
### Prerequisites
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later recommended)
-   [Bun](https://bun.sh/) package manager
-   A Cloudflare account with Wrangler CLI configured.
### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd fungicount
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses Bun for package management.

    ```
## üõ†Ô∏è Development
To start the local development server, which includes both the Vite frontend and the Cloudflare Worker backend, run:
```bash
bun dev
```
This will start the application, typically on `http://localhost:3000`. The frontend will hot-reload on changes, and the worker will restart automatically.
### Project Structure
-   `src/`: Contains the React frontend application code.
    -   `pages/`: Top-level page components for each view.
    -   `components/`: Reusable UI components, including shadcn/ui elements.
    -   `lib/`: Utility functions, API client, and state management.
-   `worker/`: Contains the Cloudflare Worker backend code.
    -   `index.ts`: The main entry point for the worker.
    -   `user-routes.ts`: API route definitions.
    -   `entities.ts`: Data models and logic for interacting with storage.
-   `shared/`: Contains TypeScript types shared between the frontend and backend.
## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment
This application is designed to be deployed to Cloudflare Pages. The `bun run deploy` script will build the application and deploy it using the Wrangler CLI.
1.  **Login to Cloudflare:**
    ```bash
    bunx wrangler login
    ```
2.  **Build and Deploy:**
    Run the deploy script from the root of the project.
    ```bash
    bun run deploy
    ```
Wrangler will handle the process of building the frontend assets, bundling the worker, and deploying them to your Cloudflare account.
Alternatively, you can deploy directly from your GitHub repository with a single click.
